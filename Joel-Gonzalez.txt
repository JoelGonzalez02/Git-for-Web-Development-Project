    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
The difference is that you can only use an id once where as you can use a class many times. Also, the specificity weight of an id is higher than a class.
For example, if you have a section of content on a page that you want style specifically, you can use a class in order to style that section 
while also having the option to use those same styles on other sections by reusing that class.
If you had for example 3 images inside of a class, you could use an id on one of the image tags in order to style only that specific image
and overwrite the class styles since an id's specificity weight is higher than a class.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
Inline elements can be nested inside of other elements without disrupting the flow of content, while elements that are displayed as a block will take up
as much space as their parent element will allow.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
The element is only positioned relative to the nearest positioned parent.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
We can use display: inline-block
 
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
<a> and <span> are inline display elements, <div> <p> and <h1> are block elements, and <img> is an inline-block element by default.

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
The box model is the set of rules that decides the size of an element as you add padding, borders, and margins around the content.
The problem with the box model is that it can cause elements to be tightly spaced and possibly overlap due to forcing the padding, border, and margin onto your content.
You can fix this by using box-sizing: border-box.
